# cfn_examples

I've tried documenting a couple of different CFN examples I thought were helpful in understanding CloudFormation stacks.

# Sections

I've broken my cfns into 2 different subtypes:
- [Regular Cloudformation examples](./Regular cfn examples)
- [SAM Transform examples](./SAM Transform examples)
